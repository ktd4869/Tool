The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle, where the centrifugal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction. At the same time, objects that are less dense are displaced and move to the center. In a laboratory centrifuge that uses sample tubes, the radial acceleration causes denser particles to settle to the bottom of the tube, while low-density substances rise to the top.", "extract_html": "<p>A <b>centrifuge</b> is a piece of equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis, applying a force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward) that can be very strong.
