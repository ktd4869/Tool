It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name \"giant panda\" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.", "extract_html": "<p>The <b>giant panda</b>, also known as <b>panda bear</b> or simply <b>panda</b>, is a bear native to south central China.
