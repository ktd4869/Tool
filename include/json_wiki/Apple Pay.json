It is supported on the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad and Mac. It digitizes and can replace a credit or debit card chip and PIN transaction at a contactless-capable point-of-sale terminal. Apple Pay does not require Apple Pay-specific contactless payment terminals; it works with any merchant that accepts contactless payments. It is very similar to contactless payments already used in many countries, with the addition of two-factor authentication via Touch ID, Face ID, PIN or passcode. The service lets Apple devices wirelessly communicate with point of sale systems by using a near field communication (NFC) antenna, a \"dedicated chip that stores encrypted payment information\", and Apple's Touch ID and Wallet.", "extract_html": "<p><b>Apple Pay</b> is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Apple Inc. that allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web.
